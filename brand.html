                            hands-on experiments for in-class and online teaching and ongoing teacher development. Each
                            experiment introduces and nurtures a real-world knowledge of math and science. Students
                            become eager to learn while gaining 21st century skills.</p>

                        introduce and nurture a real-world knowledge of math and science in an engaging way. The program
                        is already used in schools in Florida, Colorado, New Mexico, and Arizona. In each state, it’s
                        been met with positive, measurable results. Every school has seen an immense change in the
                        performance of students. Suddenly, students who have traditionally struggled with math and
                        science are engaged and excited to learn all through the power of professional tools and
                        incredibly refined physics experiments.</p>

                        <p>We are creating tomorrow’s talent TODAY. Studying physics promotes critical thinking and
                            develops a foundation for strong analytical, research and problem-solving skills. It is the
                            core of all science, math, engineering, and technology (STEM) skills and jobs.

                            Physical Science Research Associates is the fastest growing teacher development and student
                            program. It’s completely hands-on, and creates a physics classroom experience that blows
                            results from both teachers and students out of the water. Through accessible experiments
                            containing high-quality instruments, every student in the classroom can be a leader in math
                            and science. Teachers will have the tools to meet each student where they are, and elevate
                            them.</p>

                            the U.S. where they mattered most in all 50 states. Our aim was to provide ways for kids to
                            remotely learn in small groups or even at home while uncertainty kept many K-12 science labs
                            closed around the nation.</p>
